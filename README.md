If you have a group but ya wanna split a cost among 10+ people but dont want such a big hassle. Use this

This jar file was made to for gift shopping for large groups of friends

It helps to determine the cost everyone should pay, and who to pay it to

Please enter the persons who you want to split the cost among in the 'person.txt' file. Use the enter key to go to the next line, it it identifies one person per line

Also please enter the costs of each individual gift in the 'price.txt' file. Again place each the cost of one gift on each line. The dollar sign is not required.

Lastly activate the jar, and select the persons who paid for each gift.
Once you have finshed that, a new file will be created call 'Payments.txt'
In this file you will see who owes who X amount of dollars

Good luck and I hope this helps you
